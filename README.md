# Replication scripts and data for the paper 'Sub-national inequalities in progress towards SDG7 in sub-Saharan Africa'

This repository hosts:

 - A JavaScript file to import into Google Earth Engine (step 1)
 - A R script to be run after execution of the JavaScript file in Earth Engine (step 2)
 - Supporting files to run the analysis (e.g. a shapefile of provinces and QGIS files for maps replication)

- Create a Google account, if you do not have one, and require access to Earth Engine https://signup.earthengine.google.com.
- Make sure your Google Drive has enough cloud storage space available.
- Either obtain access to the LandScan population data by applying for an account (https://landscan.ornl.gov/user/apply), or use the WorldPop data, which is accessible from the script in this repository without further steps.
- Download the JavaScipt and R scripts and the supporitng files
- Run the JavaScript file in Google Earth Engine
- Run the R script, which reproduces the analysis and the plots contained in the paper.
- Open the QGIS project files to replicate maps with the appropriate layout.

Source code-related issues should be opened directly on GitHub. Broader questions of the methods should be addressed to giacomo.falchetta@feem.it
